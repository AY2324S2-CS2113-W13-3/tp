### Features implemented
**1. Enabled users to add and delete classes from timetable **

[#75](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-3/tp/commit/3ea5495a71415219b213a7aa60b819842a3bcc7f)

#### What it does:

This is a feature for managing a timetable or class schedule in a Java application. 
It allows the user to add and delete classes from a timetable, with each class having attributes such as the day of the 
week, time, duration, and location. 
The added classes can also be stored and accessed later even after the user closes the program.

**2. Handles exceptions when input has invalid format**

[#36](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-3/tp/commit/490bdfa1c41b4bd5f9ac28ab423849e7dfffaaea)

#### What it does:

The code uses a custom exception InvalidInputFormatException to handle specific cases where the input format does not meet 
the expected criteria. This exception is thrown when the input string for the expenditure does not contain the required
keywords ("d/", "amt/", "date/") in the correct order or format.

**3. J-unit Tests for Processing command**

[#55](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-3/tp/commit/defb5b548cc7a0c7ae369e62aa117a1ec44eec16)
